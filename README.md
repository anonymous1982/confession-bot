# Confessions bot
telegram bot, uses [telepot](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot)

This bot takes all messages sent to it (via its /confess command - and only in private, else it's not a confession!) and anonymously sends them to its channel set up in its config

My telegram bots are not going to be maintained while telegram uses an unversioned bot API, since I don't have the time to maintain them at a moment's notice.
